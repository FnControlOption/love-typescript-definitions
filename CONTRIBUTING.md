## Project Brief

This project aims to provide TypeScript declarations to build [LÃ–VE 2D](https://love2d.org/) projects with [TypeScriptToLua](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua).

These definitions are obtained from [the official wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) and/or the [love-api](https://github.com/love2d-community/love-api).
